Fast Fashion
====================
Greedy brands are maximizing their profits at the costs of lives
---------------------
In third world countries many live in poverty and desperation of jobs. In order to survive,are willing to work for any pay at all. Taking advantage of their situation, many brands offer unfair, huge amounts of labor for an extremely low pay. As well as horrible working conditions. An example of this is the disaster of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh. At this location, a building filled with these underpaid workers collapsed killing many people. Even though the workers had already complained about the cracks in the wall, the managers ignored these complaints. Disasters like this are not uncommon. There are harsh chemicals in these buildings, they are nowhere near safe. 

### As well as putting these lives at risk, they are causing pollution

> They dump the clothes that aren't sold in other places, polluting those countries. The water, as well, which is utilized by people who could get sick and die from this polluted water. Pesticides are used to produce more cotton for these greedy brands, but these pesticides are extremely harmful to the humans, and can cause them to lose their lives. The money is being literally sucked out of these people as they also have to pay for treatments for the pollution effects on their bodies. They have become slaves out of the greed of these companies that take no responsibility.
